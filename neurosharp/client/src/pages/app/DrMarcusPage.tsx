The daily exercises in the app target working memory and may help. If it's several times a day and others are concerned, an in-person visit is a good next step.",

The program can help with cognitive reserve. I recommend discussing your specific symptoms with a neurologist or geriatrician for a proper assessment.",
      "Your concern is valid. Early evaluation is helpful: a specialist can distinguish normal aging from something that needs treatment.

If you've missed or doubled doses more than once, tell your prescribing doctor and consider a medication review.",
